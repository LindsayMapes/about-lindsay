        As they approached the smoke they realized it was coming from a strange yet beautiful creature. A creature never seen before with sweet eyes, powerful wings and breath of fire. Lindsay approached this strange creature, slow and careful. The creature spoke and called herself Brizo. She was an ancient beast that had lived many millennia; alone, hunted, and sad. Lindsay told her that she was no threat and that she would help protect her with the aid of her trusted companion, CETO.

        Brizo, CETO and Lindsay were an unforgettable site. The Warrior Princess and her friends spent all day and all night together, protecting the villages, and living life. They would roam the mountains, seas and air and have the greatest adventures anyone could ever ask for.
