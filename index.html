    <p class="center">
        This is a story about <strong>Lindsay</strong> and <strong>Brutus the Girl</strong>. </p>


    <p class="center"> Once upon a time, Lindsay was driving up to the mountains for a party. On the way, she found a puppy on the side of the road.
        Lindsay thought, "I'll save this cute puppy from the coyotes by finding her a forever home at the party."
        At the party, everyone held and petted the puppy. One person said, "this dog is male and will be very large one day."
        Lindsay tried to get one of the people at the party to fall in love and take the puppy home.
        She did not succeed. Lindsay begrudgingly took the puppy home. Lindsay named the puppy Brutus.
        Lindsay fell in love with the flea-infested puppy. The puppy never grew large and the puppy was never a male.</p>

        Lindsay and Brutus took many adventures together. They traveled from ocean to ocean, they flew on planes, they played in the snow and in the sun.
        Brutus Girl looked after Lindsay keeping her safe from grasshoppers, racoons, and men in dark colored hoodies.
        After many adventures, Brutus Girl became old. Now, Brutus needs Lindsay to look after her; it's Lindsay's turn to keep Brutus girl safe.
        Lindsay feeds Brutus Girl medicine to keep her safe from pain and carries Brutus Girl up and down the stairs because she can't do it on her own.
        Lindsay and Brutus are true best friends.
